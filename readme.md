System calls and programming of a μshell
========================================
The goal of this practical is to study some system calls and to practise their use. Section 2 describes the basic system calls for accessing  les, and proposes making a simple program that uses them. Section 3 proposes making a small shell (command interpreter), which we will call μshell. The μshell requires the use of other system calls.

Control and communication of processes and threads
==================================================
The goal of this practical is to study the mechanisms of control and communication of processes and threads, and to practise their use making two programs  one with processes and another one with threads  that use them.
